# Deployment Ledger: <task-name>   (updated: <timestamp>)

State file for a catalyst install/analysis run. The agent reads this before each
unit of work and writes it after, so progress survives context loss and any
drift is visible against a written record. Deploy to
`.catalyst-proj/.ledger/<task>.todo.md` in the target repo.
