# Proposal: a generic entity/workflow kernel, and cutting the repetition tax

**Status:** draft, for review — not committed, not part of the framework's
own governed structure yet.
**Scope:** the `catalyst` framework itself (`framework/`). Does
not touch `catalyst-ui` directly, though §6 covers what this would mean for
it as the framework's reference product.

## 0. The ask, restated

Two threads, tightly coupled:

1. **Efficiency** — running catalyst (adding an entity type, syncing a
   deployment, dogfooding) burns tokens on repetitive, mechanical work.
2. **Generality & Modular Prompts** — catalyst should eventually govern *any*
   process, not just software engineering. The existing software development
   prompts, slash commands, and workflows need to be treated as a discrete
   module called **software-development** (or `software-engineering`), allowing
   catalyst to seamlessly load and swap other prompt modules for different
   project management types (e.g. Agile Scrum, ITIL service management, legal/compliance,
   product management). The actual artifact types + prompt workflows +
   interdependencies should be a **design-time choice** an architect/admin makes
   per deployment, not something hardcoded into the kernel's source.

These aren't separate problems. The repetition *is*, almost entirely, the
cost of every entity type being hand-authored prose baked into the
framework's own template files instead of data a generic engine reads. Fix
the second and most of the first goes away for free.

## 1. Evidence: what adding one entity type actually costs today

This session added two entities (`STEP-`, `TEST-`) and one field-widening
change (a step's parent: requirement-only → requirement-or-bug). Each
touched, by hand, every time:

- `rules-of-rules.template.md` — new/amended `rr-META-NNN` section, plus
  edits to the ID-format line, the entity-id-suffix list (§20), the
  "where every artifact type sits" list (§15).
- `rules-of-development.template.md` — the §3 type table, the hard-rule
  bullet list, a type-description bullet, the §4 command bullet *and* its
  procedural block, the §6 ID format string, a §7 closing-item bullet.
- `INVARIANTS.md` — a new `INV-N`.
- A new `templates/<type>.template.md`.
- A new `definitions/<type>/DEFINITION-<TYPE>-v1.md`, plus a
  `definitions/README.md` edit.
- `SYNCHRONIZE.md` — a required-artifacts checklist edit *and* a new
  migration paragraph.
- A new `migrations/<version>/*.md` file, plus a `migrations.md` row.
- `templates/Taskfile.common.template.yml` — a new task.
- `scripts/check_deployment.py` — an `ENTITY_TYPES` edit.
- `INSTANTIATION-GUIDE.md`, `INSTANTIATION-CHECKLIST.md`,
  `ARTIFACT-LAYOUT.md` — each got its own tree/checklist edit.
- Three separate top-level READMEs (`README.md`,
  `framework/kernel/README.md`, `templates/README.md`) — each
  separately re-describes the same new type in its own words.
- A new `.claude/commands/create-<type>.md`.

**That's 17+ files, by hand, for one entity type** — and then the *entire
list repeats* against catalyst's own dogfooded `.criterion`, and again
against every deployed project's `.criterion`, and again (if there's a
real product on top, like catalyst-ui) in actual application code.

The framework has shipped 17 migrations since `0.11.0`. The pattern
repeats every time. Concretely, in *this session alone*, the repetition
directly caused real drift bugs I had to catch and fix mid-task:
`definitions/README.md`'s type list silently fell out of sync twice; a
`CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md` paragraph was missing entirely from one dogfood copy;
`Rules-of-Rules.md`'s own "where every type sits" list was missing two
entries. Six files independently claiming to be *the* list of entity
types is not a design, it's a liability — the token cost and the
correctness cost come from the same root cause.

## 2. Root cause

The framework's actual reusable machinery — the ID+userid scheme
(`rr-META-003/020`), the uniform artifact-type layout (`rr-META-015`,
INV-20), IAM/signing (`rr-META-011`), the append-only journal
(`rr-META-012`), criterion sync (`rr-META-013`), plugin activation
(`rr-META-017`) — is **already fully domain-agnostic**. None of it
mentions "rule" or "bug" or "requirement" by name. This part is fine as
it stands and should not change.

What's *not* generic is layered directly on top, hardcoded into the
framework's own prose:

- The **chain invariant** itself (INV-5: "no work without a link to a
  documented rule") is a software-engineering assumption wearing a
  framework-wide invariant's clothes.
- Every entity type's **shape** (its fields, which are required, which
  are lists, what they reference) and **workflow** (status enum,
  transition rules, what blocks closing) exist only as scattered prose
  across the ~17 files in §1 — never as one machine-readable source of
  truth a tool could read, generate from, or validate against.
- Existing **software development prompts and commands** (such as slash
  commands defined in `.claude/commands/`, agent skills, and workflow
  prompts) are baked directly into kernel prose rather than being
  isolated into a standalone module.
- Adding a type currently means **editing the framework's own source**
  (`framework/*.template.md`) and cutting a framework
  version + migration. There is no way for a deployed project's own
  architect/admin to add a type without either forking the framework or
  asking an agent to hand-edit framework internals on their behalf — which
  is exactly backwards from "design-time choice per deployment."

## 3. Proposed architecture: kernel + profile

Split the framework into two layers:

### 3a. Kernel (stays framework-core, rarely changes)

Everything already domain-agnostic, unchanged: ID+userid scheme, INV-20
uniform layout, IAM/roles/signing, the journal, criterion sync, plugin
activation, `/criterion push`'s vet+merge. Plus one new, deliberately
small primitive:

- **Entity Type Definition (ETD)** — a machine-readable schema, one file
  per type, living in the *deployment*, not the framework:
  `.criterion/schema/entity-types/<TYPE>.yaml`. Declares: id prefix,
  folder, fields (name, kind — `text`/`enum`/`ref`/`ref-list`/`date`),
  cardinality on any `ref`/`ref-list` field, which field(s) are the
  **grounding link** (see below), and a **workflow** block (states,
  which states count as "closed," what a transition requires).
- **Relationship** — declared *on* a `ref`/`ref-list` field: target
  type, optional `backref` name (the field the target type gets for
  free, the way `TEST.Requirements` back-populates `REQ.Tests` today).
- **Grounding type** — the kernel generalizes INV-5 from "must link to a
  rule" to "may declare a grounding type it must link to." A profile
  picks its own grounding type (software-engineering's is `rule`; a
  legal profile's might be `policy`, a support-ops profile's might have
  none). A type's ETD says `grounding: required | inherited | none` —
  `inherited` is what `STEP-` does today (inherits its parent's), `none`
  is what `FEAT-`/`RM-`/`WORKFLOW-` do today.

This is genuinely small: one schema format, one generalized invariant,
one place relationships/back-references are declared instead of
re-derived by hand per type.

### 3b. Profile & Prompt Modules (per-deployment, author-owned)

A **profile** is a named bundle containing Entity Type Definitions (ETDs), a chosen grounding type, seed content, and a dedicated **Prompt Module**:

- **Prompt Module concept:** Existing software development prompts (slash commands such as `/create-req`, `/create-bug`, `/check-rules`, `/cut-release`, skills stored in `.claude/skills/` or `.claude/commands/`, and procedural instructions) are decoupled from the kernel and packaged as a module named `software-development` (or `software-engineering`).
- **Pluggable project management types:** By encapsulating prompts into modules, Catalyst can support other modules for different project management types (e.g. Agile Scrum, Kanban, ITIL service management, Product Management, Legal/Compliance tracking, or Physical Engineering).
- **Module structure:** Each project management module bundles its own set of prompt files, slash command definitions (following `.claude/commands/` patterns), agent skills, and ETDs without modifying the Catalyst core kernel.

The framework ships `software-development` as the **default module/profile**,
authored via ETDs and modular prompts like everything else — dogfooding the new mechanism to
define the old one, rather than keeping two parallel systems.
An architect/admin creates a new type or adapts a process by writing ETD files or attaching a prompt module in their own deployment. No kernel version bump, no migration, no asking an
agent to hand-edit `framework/`. That *is* "design-time
choice, their own way."

### 3c. What a generic engine derives from one ETD and Prompt Module, instead of being hand-written per type

- The human-facing document template (field table + sections) —
  generated once from the ETD, not authored separately.
- `/create-<type>` and workflow prompt behaviors — parameterized by the active prompt module and ETDs. Generic command handlers or modular prompt definitions (like `.claude/commands/` files) read the ETDs and module configuration; no hand-written kernel prose per type or process.
- Validation — orphan/registered/grounding/dangling-reference checks,
  today hand-written per type in `validator.ts`-equivalent logic,
  become one generic pass parameterized by the ETD.
- Back-reference population — `TEST.Requirements` → `REQ.Tests`
  happens automatically because the relationship says so, not because
  someone remembered to write the "append to the other side" step.
- Closing/done criteria — read from the workflow block instead of a
  hand-written §7 bullet.

## 4. Concrete moves that cut token/repetition cost specifically

Some of these are payoffs of §3; a few are independent and can land
first, regardless of the bigger decision:

1. **One canonical entity registry, everything else references it.**
   Collapse the 6 hand-maintained "here's the list of types" copies
   (top-level `README.md`, `framework/kernel/README.md`,
   `templates/README.md`, `INSTANTIATION-GUIDE.md`,
   `INSTANTIATION-CHECKLIST.md`, `ARTIFACT-LAYOUT.md`) into one source
   — under the new model, that's literally "the set of ETD files in the
   active profile" — with the rest either linking to it or generated
   from it. `scripts/check_deployment.py` already validates against one
   `ENTITY_TYPES` tuple; extend that pattern to *generate* the docs
   that currently drift, not just check them after the fact.
2. **Scope four-eyes verification to the actual diff.** Today, syncing
   or dogfooding a change re-reads the whole corpus for a second,
   independent pass. When a change is a well-scoped ETD add/edit, the
   independent check only needs to verify that specific schema + its
   generated artifacts, not re-derive the entire deployment's rule
   coverage from scratch. Reserve full blind re-derivation
   (`/dogfood recreate`'s existing mode) for periodic audits.
3. **Leaner journal entries for mechanical changes.** The journal's
   `intent` field is prose because most past changes needed judgment
   calls explained. A schema-driven ETD add is not one of those — a
   structured entry (`{op: "add-entity-type", etd: "TEST", version:
   "0.30.0"}`) is more honest *and* cheaper than three paragraphs of
   narrative reconstructing what a diff already shows.
4. **Cache what's already been verified.** The journal already tracks
   per-file content hashes before/after. `/check-rules` and `/dogfood`
   could skip re-validating a file whose hash hasn't changed since its
   last clean check, instead of a full-corpus pass every time.
5. **Split session-start cost from task cost.** `INVARIANTS.md` re-injects
   every session (correct — cheap, anti-drift). Heavier guides
   (`INSTANTIATION-GUIDE.md`, `ANALYSIS-PLAYBOOK.md`) should stay
   read-on-demand only, not bundled into routine-session overhead — this
   is likely already true; worth auditing `BOOTSTRAP.md §1`'s actual load
   sequence to confirm nothing heavier than INVARIANTS.md loads by
   default.

## 5. Migration path & Roadmap (this is itself a framework change — same discipline)

Backward-compatible, phased, each phase independently shippable (detailed step-by-step roadmap available in [ROADMAP-software-engineering-module.md](ROADMAP-software-engineering-module.md)):

- **Phase 0 (no architecture change, ships immediately):** the quick
  wins in §4 that don't depend on ETDs existing — registry
  consolidation for the 6 duplicated doc lists, journal entry
  leaning-out for mechanical ops, hash-based check caching.
- **Phase 1 (module spec & kernel generalization):** define the ETD schema format, `module.yaml` manifest structure, and generalize INV-5 into the grounding-type concept. No existing deployment's behavior changes yet — this only adds the *capability*.
- **Phase 2 (software engineering module extraction):** re-express today's `BUG`/`REQ`/`HK`/
  `TEST`/`STEP`/`FEAT`/`RM`/`WORKFLOW`/`RECON` as the
  `software-engineering` module's own ETDs, slash commands (`/create-req`, `/create-bug`, etc.), and templates. A migration (like every
  past one) converts a deployment's existing hardcoded shape into
  module-backed form, byte-for-byte compatible — existing artifacts don't
  move or get renamed.
- **Phase 3 (generic engine & prompt loader):** the agent's own procedures
  (`/create-<type>`, validation, sync) become module/ETD-driven instead of
  reading hardcoded prose. This is where the token savings in §4 items
  2–4 actually land in the agent's real day-to-day behavior.
- **Phase 4 (author tooling & multi-module validation):** a real `/create-entity-type` (or
  equivalent) command so an architect/admin authors a new ETD or module
  conversationally, without hand-writing YAML, and validation against non-software modules to prove kernel isolation.

Each phase gets its own version bump + migration doc, exactly like every
change so far — this proposal doesn't ask the framework to abandon its
own discipline, just to stop hand-copying the same information into 17
places per change.

## 6. What this means for catalyst-ui (not in scope to build now, flagging the shape)

`catalyst-core`'s parser today hardcodes `DevArtifactType =
"bug"|"requirement"|"house-keeping"|"test"` plus one parser function,
one validator branch, one tree section, and one icon per type — the
same repetition pattern as the framework's own docs, just in TypeScript.
An ETD-driven world implies `catalyst-core` eventually reads a
deployment's own ETDs and parses/validates/displays *any* declared type
generically, rather than needing a code change per type. That's a real
rearchitecture of `catalyst-core`'s parser and `catalyst-host-vscode`'s
tree-building — flagged here for sequencing, not proposed as part of
this framework-side plan.

## 7. Risks / honest tradeoffs

- A generic engine is harder to reason about at a glance than
  hand-written prose per type — the framework's current verbosity is
  partly *because* prose is easy to review. Mitigation: the generated
  human-facing template/docs stay the actual review surface; the ETD is
  the source, not a replacement for readable output.
- This is a genuine kernel change (INV-5 generalizes) — needs care that
  every *existing* deployment's behavior is provably unchanged
  post-migration, not just "should be."
- Scope creep risk: "any process" is a big ambition. `software-engineering`
  migrating to a real ETD-defined profile (§8) is the proof point — the
  framework should not claim to support a second domain until that
  migration is clean and every existing dogfooded behavior is provably
  unchanged.

## 8. Decisions (confirmed 2026-09-20)

1. **Sequencing:** hold everything — including the §4/Phase 0 quick
   wins — until this whole plan is reviewed and approved as one unit.
   Nothing ships piecemeal ahead of that.
2. **Architecture:** the kernel/profile split (§3) is the direction —
   Entity Type Definitions an architect/admin authors per deployment,
   not framework-hardcoded types.
3. **Profile & Prompt Module status:** `software-engineering` (or `software-development`) migrates to be a real, ETD-defined profile and prompt module (not a permanently privileged hardcoded default) — Phase 2 in §5 is confirmed scope, not optional. This proves the mechanism against catalyst's own real complexity and avoids the framework permanently carrying two parallel ways of defining a type.
4. **Modular Prompts:** Existing software development prompts (slash commands, skills, procedural guidance) are packaged as the `software-development` module, establishing the architecture for Catalyst to plug in additional modules for other project management types.

This plan is now considered final pending explicit go-ahead to begin
Phase 0. No implementation work has started.
