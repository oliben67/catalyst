# Rules of Work Items — template

> Copy to `{{WORK_ITEMS_DIR}}/rules-of-work-items.md` and resolve every

Standards for the agile process layer — epics, stories, tasks, spikes,
sprints (or your methodology's equivalents; see the "Agile-methodology
agnostic" note in the framework [`README.md`](README.md)). Sits above
`CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md`, which sits above
`{{RULES_DIR}}/Rules-of-Rules.md`. Work items never bypass that chain.

## 1. A story is not a substitute for a `REQ-`/`BUG-` doc

Every `STORY-NNNNNN` links to exactly one `REQ-NNNNNN` (or `BUG-NNNNNN`). The
`REQ-`/`BUG-` doc owns rule targets, conflict checks, and new-rule
proposals. The story is the sized, scheduled slice of that same work.

If a story has no `REQ-`/`BUG-` doc yet, create one before pulling the
story into a sprint/iteration. (A `FEAT-NNNNNN` entry may motivate a story
too, but it never substitutes for the `REQ-`/`BUG-` doc — features aren't
rule-linked; see `Rules-of-Rules.md` §9.)

## 2. Tasks inherit their parent story's rule target

A `TASK-NNNNNN` never gets its own rule target — it inherits its parent
story's. If task-level work needs a rule the story doesn't cover, fix the
story/feature doc first rather than letting scope creep in unreviewed.

## 3. Spikes exist to produce rules or estimates, not code

A `SPIKE-NNNNNN` is time-boxed and never itself "implements" anything. Its
outcome is a new rule proposal (handed to a `REQ-NNNNNN`), an
implementation approach, or a go/no-go decision. A spike that ships
production code has stopped being a spike.

## 4. Epics are decomposition, not a fourth rule namespace

An epic names the `DOMAIN` code(s) it spans and groups child stories. It
never targets a rule directly. "Done" means all child stories are done.

## 5. Iteration containers schedule work items; they don't reclassify them

Whatever container your methodology uses (`SPRINT-NNN`, `BOARD-NNNNNN`,
etc.) holds `STORY-`/`TASK-`/`SPIKE-` IDs as-is — it never restates
acceptance criteria or rule targets. Retro/review action items that imply
a process change get filed as `HK-NNNNNN`, not left as an untracked note.

## 6. Boards are Kanban/Scrumban's container, not Scrum's

A `BOARD-NNNNNN` is the Kanban-flavor structural counterpart to
`SPRINT-NNN` (§2 of `INSTANTIATION-GUIDE.md`): a trackable container,
`Status` of `Active`/`Archived`, that stories/tasks reference instead of
sprint membership. A pure-Scrum deployment has no need for it, the same
way a pure-Kanban deployment has no need for `sprints/` — pick the one
your flavor actually uses, not both by default.

## 7. Workflows document a process, they are not themselves work

A `WORKFLOW-NNNNNN` is a process-definition document — how a category of
work moves through its steps (e.g. "how a bug moves from triage to
resolution") — never a unit of work with acceptance criteria. `Status` is
`Active`/`Deprecated`, reflecting whether the process is currently in
use; a workflow is never "done" the way a story or task is.

## 8. Tickets are a plugin-territory slot, not a core work-item type

`tickets/` is scaffolded like every other artifact type (`Rules-of-Rules.md`
§15) but core catalyst defines no `TICKET-NNNNNN` semantics, no `/create-ticket`
command, and no lifecycle for it. Its actual population — typically
syncing from or mirroring an external tracker — is the job of whichever
project-management-type plugin is activated for that concern
(`Rules-of-Rules.md` §8, INV-13). If no such plugin is active, the folder
stays empty; that is not a deployment error.

## 9. IDs

Per `Rules-of-Rules.md` §8: `(EPIC|STORY|TASK|SPIKE|BOARD|WORKFLOW)-NNNNNN`
(6 digits), `SPRINT-NNN` (3 digits), each sequence global within its own
type, never reused. `TICKET-NNNNNN` is reserved but not core-managed (§8
above) — whichever plugin populates it owns its own ID/sequencing
behavior.

## 10. Templates

| Type | Folder | Template |
|---|---|---|
| Board | `boards/` | `templates/board.template.md` |
| Epic | `epics/` | `templates/epic.template.md` |
| Story | `stories/` | `templates/story.template.md` |
| Task | `tasks/` | `templates/task.template.md` |
| Spike | `spikes/` | `templates/spike.template.md` |
| Sprint | `sprints/` | `templates/sprint.template.md` |
| Workflow | `workflows/` | `templates/workflow.template.md` |
| Ticket | `tickets/` | (plugin-provided — §8 above) |

Each folder's template deploys nested and versioned per
`Rules-of-Rules.md` §15 — e.g. `boards/templates/TEMPLATE-BOARD-v1.md`,
not a bare `boards/TEMPLATE-BOARD.md`.
