# Repository Plugins Index

This index catalogs repository-oriented plugins available in the framework, and pins
the repository, release, and tag of each plugin that ships with a given catalyst
release.

The `Compatibility` column records which catalyst framework versions the
plugin supports. A bare `*` means the plugin is compatible with every
framework version — this is the default for a registered plugin, and
`/sync-framework` must never deactivate the plugin on that basis. A future
convention allows specific version constraints in this column instead,
expressed with the same range syntax used in a dependency lock file, to
mark the plugin as excluded from named framework versions.
