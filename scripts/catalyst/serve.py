"""`catalyst serve` and its share driver (roadmap R3.9).

The server is a remote that understands catalyst. It keeps every version of
a criterion's files as git blobs and takes pushes one batch at a time; each
person's criterion stays in catalyst's home and works offline
(`what-is-going-on/19-server-design.md`, decisions of 2026-10-10).

Server side (`Server`, SQLite from the standard library):

- the truth is `batches` (who pushed, when), `changes` (each file's
  `before` and `after` in a batch) and `blobs` (every version, by its git
  hash, checked on arrival); `files` (each path's current version) and
  `ids` (which file holds which artifact ID) are derived, and `rebuild`
  recomputes them;
- a push is applied all or nothing. It is refused, with nothing applied,
  when a file moved on the server since the client's version (409), when a
  journal shard is not appended to, when a change to a file the server
  already has is not journaled, when a new entry names a signer other than
  the token's user, when an artifact ID is already another file's, or when
  a `RECON-` case changes beyond the signer's `reconciliation` level;
- the first push is an import: it brings the whole history, signed by
  whoever made it, so only its signers are not checked;
- every request carries a bearer token; the server stores only its hash.
  Tokens are issued and revoked on the server's host (`catalyst serve
  token`).

Client side (`ServeShare`, the `serve` share driver): `catalyst.toml` has
`share = "serve"` and `share_url = "<url>"`; the token is in
`$CATALYST_HOME/credentials` (`catalyst share login`), never in a criterion
or a project. The client remembers the server's state it last saw (batch
number, each file's version) in the criterion's git directory: a file that
differs from it is a local change, and a pull that would overwrite one
stops with nothing written.

JSON over HTTP, `/v1`: `GET head`, `GET changes?since=<batch>`,
`GET blobs/<sha>`, `POST have` (which blobs the server lacks), `POST push`.
The read side (R3.9 S3) answers what the CLI's read commands
answer, with their own code over the server's current files:
`GET list?type=&filter=`, `GET view/<id>`, `GET backlog`,
`GET journal?since=&artifact=&actor=&rule=`, `GET graph` (header
`X-Catalyst-Batch`: the batch the answer is for), and `GET events`, a
server-sent event stream of batch numbers.

Local mode (`catalyst serve --local`, `LocalReader`): the same read
endpoints over one project's own criterion, read-only, on loopback, with a
token made for the run; `GET check` returns `catalyst check --json`. A
client reads every criterion the same way, served or not.
