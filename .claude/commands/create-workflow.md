argument-hint: <process-name>

Create a new process-definition document. Full spec:
`.criterion/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md` §4,
`.criterion/work-items/rules-of-work-items.md`, template:
`.criterion/work-items/workflows/templates/TEMPLATE-WORKFLOW-v1.md`.
Input: $ARGUMENTS

**Not a unit of work** — no parent epic/story link, never itself "done."
Documents how a category of work moves through its steps.

1. Resolve the next `WORKFLOW-NNNNNN` ID (6 digits) from
   `workflows/workflows.md` + a directory listing of
   `workflows/`.
2. `Status: Active` (only ever `Active` or `Deprecated` — never a
   work-tracking lifecycle).
3. Resolve who is signing this per CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md §2 and fill
   `Signed-off-by`.
4. Copy the current `TEMPLATE-WORKFLOW-vN.md`, fill every field, save as
   `workflows/WORKFLOW-NNNNNN-<short-summary>.md`.
5. Register it in `workflows/workflows.md`.
6. Report the result. Do not commit or push — leave changes unstaged
   unless the user asks otherwise.
