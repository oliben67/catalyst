# Catalyst — Claude Code entry

You are running catalyst as **Claude Code**. Load `BOOTSTRAP.md` from this
repository and follow it top to bottom. It is the single source of truth; this
file only records what Claude Code adds on top.

Capabilities you have (use them per `BOOTSTRAP.md §1`):
- **Sub-agents:** use `Agent` calls with `run_in_background: true`, launched in
  the same message so they run in parallel, `subagent_type: general-purpose`,
  and `model: opus` for the long reading passes in `ANALYSIS-PLAYBOOK.md`.
- **Persistent memory:** record the deployment target note there.
- **Slash commands:** register the framework commands (`/create-bug`,
  `/create-req`, `/create-feature`, `/meta-tag`, `/status`, `/run-analysis`,
  `/help`, `/catalyzer`).
- **Hooks:** if `.claude/settings.json` is present, its `SessionStart` hook
  re-injects `INVARIANTS.md` and its `Stop` hook runs the deployment validator —
  the enforcement layer of the anti-drift architecture. You do not need to
  simulate these; the harness runs them.

Everything else: `BOOTSTRAP.md`.
